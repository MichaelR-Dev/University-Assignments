### Grocery-Tracking-App

- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

```
This project utilizes Python embedding along with C++ to create a windows executable for parsing grocery lists with item quantity.
```

- What did you do particularly well?

```
I was most proud of, and believe I did exceptionally well with maintaining clear and concise code in both languages.  
With proper documentation, and standardizing method summaries, I believe I achieved a pretty seamless integration of C++/Python.
```

- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

```
Utilizing proper parsing for CSV or other serialized formats would be a huge improvement to this project.  
As is, it utilizes a line-by-line basis for the grocery list with pretty strict schema.
```

- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

```
Getting familiar with the Python Embedding API would be a huge plus to this project.  
My biggest challenge was dealing with the Python Embedded methods beyond the basic initialize. 
Dealing with different data return types, etc. proved to be a big challenge for me to get familiar with their documentation.
```

- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

```
Modularizing the Read/Write process for files, in both languages will be absolutely paramount for implementing moving forward. 
I really enjoyed working with read/write and iostream in module form, allowing for fast work flow in the future.
```

- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

```
Ensuring I provided brief explanations to each function/method, as well as parameter types/explanations in the descriptions
above them was a huge impact on readability throughout this process.  Again, the modularity with the read/write and iostream made this program very adaptable
and easy to minimize written code with maximum functionality.
```

### Software Design Docs

- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
```

```
- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
```

```
- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
```

```
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
```

```
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
```

```
- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
```

```
