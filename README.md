### Grocery-Tracking-App

- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

```
This project utilizes Python embedding along with C++ to create a windows executable for parsing grocery lists with item quantity.
```

- What did you do particularly well?

```
I was most proud of, and believe I did exceptionally well with maintaining clear and concise code in both languages.  
With proper documentation, and standardizing method summaries, I believe I achieved a pretty seamless integration of C++/Python.
```

- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

```
Utilizing proper parsing for CSV or other serialized formats would be a huge improvement to this project.  
As is, it utilizes a line-by-line basis for the grocery list with pretty strict schema.
```

- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

```
Getting familiar with the Python Embedding API would be a huge plus to this project.  
My biggest challenge was dealing with the Python Embedded methods beyond the basic initialize. 
Dealing with different data return types, etc. proved to be a big challenge for me to get familiar with their documentation.
```

- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

```
Modularizing the Read/Write process for files, in both languages will be absolutely paramount for implementing moving forward. 
I really enjoyed working with read/write and iostream in module form, allowing for fast work flow in the future.
```

- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

```
Ensuring I provided brief explanations to each function/method, as well as parameter types/explanations in the descriptions
above them was a huge impact on readability throughout this process.  Again, the modularity with the read/write and iostream made this program very adaptable
and easy to minimize written code with maximum functionality.
```

### Software Design Docs

- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
```
The Gaming Room was a client seeking software/hardware architecture design consultation. The client was seeking to utilize the best software/hardware architecture to support scalability and performance with a multi-platform (Mobile/Desktop/Web) game. 
```
- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
```
Using the same method I used when highlighting the importance of a CDN/Caching game flow and how it becomes effective for multi-platforms with varying device limitations while also maximizing savings in laymen terms, I believe is something done particularly well to sell the client on recommendations.
```
- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
```
Having a design document is a great way to ensure that during development, there is no straying in stack usage.  With the headspace of what other frameworks and services/architecture would be used, it's easier to be confident when developing the code with certain patterns.
```
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
```
Revising the OS comparisons would be my first focus. Though the OS are differentiated and analyzed, I feel as if I could have simplified it further with bullet points and the facts for brief understanding of comparison.
```
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
```
Considering the user's needs when designing is important, because just as much as the client has constraints, the end-users have constraints themselves. Whether it be how the design is understood in runtime, or the overall user experience being fluid and well adopted on any platform, it's important to consider these when deciding on the best universally accepted design for all use cases. The design document itself must be suitable for developers as well to build off of, and this is something to also be considered which makes it a juggle to have the design document understood and curated to each of these 3 figures.
```
- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
```
In approaching the software design, it's important to build from the "ground" up. Though in the case of software design, these are usually hard to visualize without a picture of the end-product. If we consider the end product, and sort of 'reverse engineer' it in our head at a high level, it really helps to consider what type of end users we'll be dealing with, which is very important in moving forward with the process of "shaping" the perfect UX into the constraints of the client themselves. Having this high level understanding of the product concept, is the best obstacle to strategize and analyze around, slowly taking and giving according to the design constraints.
